# Getting Started with Create React App

Hello CentralApp team,
This project is running [here](https://kevintss.github.io/assignement--centralapp/).
Sorry for the delay, is made it works, just few point are not completed:

- [ ] Is the UI aesthetically pleasing? (only you can judge 😁)
- [ ] How good is the UX (keyboard handling, input focus, etc)
- [ ] (Bonus) Transitions/Animations
- [ ] Performance (perceived and actual)

Hope you will like it anyway. Wish you a lovely Week Kevin
